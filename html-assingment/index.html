            <p>
                Hi my name is Deepak Dhir i am 19 yrs old. I am an international student 
                from India, Punjab. I am enrolled in <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> at <em>Algonquin College</em>. I am graduated from mass media and communication in grade 12, 
                in this course i have studied about film making, photography, little bit about html. But after my grade 12 my interest generated toward the fields which <abbr title="Interactive Media Desin">IMD</abbr>
                offers and now i'm interested in doing <em>graphic desinging, photography, web designing(using wordpress),</em> but a little weak at codings but i believe that after this program and with the help of experienced teachers i will be able to every thing professionally.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my leisure time i practice coding and aslo watch tutorials of programming languages in order to learn more i read and try examples on 
              <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/"> W3Schools.com.</a>In addition to this, I like to do cooking, and i'm a music buff person so like listen songs.
              I always find my lacking and work on them i wish to have a successful life. In future, i want to set up a company which will provide services like graphic designing, web designing, videography, and photography, etc.
            </p>
